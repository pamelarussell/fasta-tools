## fasta-tools: Simple programs to manipulate fasta files

### For all programs:

Run with `-h` for usage

### Program descriptions:

#### `fasta_seq_lens.sh`

Get lengths of all sequences in a fasta file

#### `fasta_single_line.sh`

Convert fasta file to have each sequence on a single line (not including header)

#### `fasta_seq_extractor.pl`

Extract entire sequences whose names match a regular expression and/or list of sequence headers

#### `fasta_region_extractor.pl`

Extract a given region from a given sequence in a fasta file

#### `pairwise_align_bed_regions.py`

Perform pairwise alignments between sequences extracted from a fasta file using BED records

#### `pairwise_alignment.py`

Perform a pairwise global alignment between two sequences in a fasta file
